## HTTP/0.9 File Serving Example

The `server` and `client` examples demonstrate fetching files using a HTTP-like toy protocol.

1. Server (`server.rs`)

The server listens for any client requesting a file. 
If the file path is valid and allowed, it returns the contents. 

Open up a terminal and execute:

```text
$ cargo run --example server ./
```

2. Client (`client.rs`)

The client requests a file and prints it to the console. 
If the file is on the server, it will receive the response. 

In a new terminal execute:

```test
$ cargo run --example client https://localhost:4433/README.md
```

**Result:**

The output will be the contents of this README.

**Troubleshooting:**

If the client times out with no activity on the server, try forcing the server to run on IPv4 by
running it with `cargo run --example server -- ./ --listen 127.0.0.1:4433`. The server listens on
IPv6 by default, `localhost` tends to resolve to IPv4, and support for accepting IPv4 packets on
IPv6 sockets varies between platforms.

## Minimal Example
The `connection.rs` example intends to use the smallest amount of code to make a simple QUIC connection.
The server issues it's own certificate and passes it to the client to trust.

```text
$ cargo run --example connection
```

This example will make a QUIC connection on localhost, and you should see output like:

```text
[server] incoming connection: id=3680c7d3b3ebd250 addr=127.0.0.1:50469
[client] connected: id=61a2df1548935aeb, addr=127.0.0.1:5000
```

## Insecure Connection Example

The `insecure_connection.rs` example demonstrates how to make a QUIC connection that ignores the server certificate.

```text
$ cargo run --example insecure_connection --features="rustls/dangerous_configuration"
```

## Single Socket Example

You can have multiple QUIC connections over a single UDP socket. This is especially
useful, if you are building a peer-to-peer system where you potentially need to communicate with
thousands of peers or if you have a
[hole punched](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDP_hole_punching) UDP socket.
Additionally, QUIC servers and clients can both operate on the same UDP socket.
This example demonstrates how to make multiple outgoing connections on a single UDP socket.

```text 
$ cargo run --example single_socket
```

The expected output should be something like:

```text
[server] incoming connection: id=bdd481e853111f09 addr=127.0.0.1:43149
[server] incoming connection: id=bfdeae5f7a67d89f addr=127.0.0.1:43149
[server] incoming connection: id=36ae757fc0d81d6a addr=127.0.0.1:43149
[client] connected: id=751758ed2c93350e, addr=127.0.0.1:5001
[client] connected: id=3722568139d78726, addr=127.0.0.1:5000
[client] connected: id=621265b108a59fad, addr=127.0.0.1:5002
```

Notice how the server sees multiple incoming connections with different IDs coming from the same
endpoint.
